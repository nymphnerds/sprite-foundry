## NymphsCore Fork

This fork adapts Sprite Foundry to run generation through NymphsCore instead of
ComfyUI. NymphsCore is a local modular AI runtime/manager; Nymphs Image provides
the Z-Image Turbo backend used here, with Nunchaku acceleration, Z-Image LoRA
support, configurable sprite sizes, and planned ControlNet/depth parity.

The goal is to keep Sprite Foundry's excellent review, gating, lifecycle,
map/finish, and export system intact while swapping in a Nymphs-native
generation path: `foundry generate-nymphscore`.

Huge thanks to the original Sprite Foundry author and MCP Tool Shop for making
this clean, thoughtful system available under MIT.

If this NymphsCore path is useful upstream, we'd be happy to compare notes.

Sprite Foundry is a local-only asset pipeline that generates, reviews, and exports 8-direction pixel sprites with normal and depth maps. This fork drives Nymphs Image / Z-Image Turbo for generation, uses SQLite for lifecycle tracking, and keeps the Godot 4.6 finish-lab lighting verification path.

## Monster Lane

Non-humanoid creatures use body-class-specific depth guides in the original ComfyUI path. This fork keeps those configs and review gates while the NymphsCore backend grows toward Z-Image ControlNet/depth parity.

| Body Class | Depth Strength | End % | Creatures |
|------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Amorphous | 0.35 | 65% | Rat King, Spore Mother, Mud Revenant |
| Wide/Squat | 0.40 | 70% | Grinning Idol |
| Tall/Thin | 0.40 | 70% | Lantern Angler, Root Puppet |

Depth guides are joint-free primitives (blobs, pillars, columns) that lock in mass and orientation without dictating skeleton or limb placement. The `body_class` field in character configs auto-selects the correct preset:

```bash
# Original ComfyUI body class path
python -m pipeline.foundry_gen_morph --config pipeline/chars/beast_rat_king.json

# CLI override
python -m pipeline.foundry_gen_morph --config pipeline/chars/beast_rat_king.json --body-class tall_thin
```

## Export Contract v1.0.0 (frozen)

```
exports/{subject_slug}/{run_id}/
├── albedo/    8 × transparent PNGs
├── normal/    8 × matching normal maps
├── depth/     8 × matching depth maps
├── preview/   contact sheet
└── manifest.json  (schema v1.0.0, SHA-256 checksums, provenance)
```

- 8 directions: front, front_left, left, back_left, back, back_right, right, front_right
- Original contract: 48×48 transparent PNG, center_bottom pivot
- NymphsCore fork: configurable `--sprite-size` from 24 to 512, default 96
- Consumers validate `schema_version: "1.0.0"` before loading

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Nymphs Image running locally, usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8090`
- Z-Image Turbo model with Nunchaku runtime support
- A Z-Image Turbo-compatible sprite/pixel-art LoRA
- ComfyUI is optional legacy/reference runtime for the original generation scripts
- Godot 4.6 (for finish lab rendering)
- NVIDIA GPU recommended

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/sprite-foundry.git
cd sprite-foundry

# Initialize the registry
python -m foundry init

# Register a subject
python -m foundry subject-add sera_vale "Sera Vale" --role crew --consumer star-freight

# Check the full pipeline status
python -m foundry status

# Generate through Nymphs Image / Z-Image Turbo
python -m foundry.cli generate-nymphscore \
  --config pipeline/chars/thal.json \
  --nymphscore-url http://127.0.0.1:8090 \
  --sprite-size 96
```

## Threat Model

Sprite Foundry is a **local developer tool**. It does not:

- Access external services by default; generation calls local Nymphs Image on localhost
- Handle secrets, tokens, or credentials
- Collect or send telemetry
- Write outside its own working directory

File operations are constrained to `exports/`, `bakeoff/`, `boards/`, `derived/`, and the SQLite registry. Subprocess calls are limited to local generation APIs and Godot headless rendering.
